      <p>From <a href="https://www.justonecookbook.com/ginger-pork-shogayaki/">Just One Cookbook</a>. I haven't had a chance to make this dish yet, but I want to try cooking this dish soon! In Japanese, this dish is called "Shougayaki". Shouga is ginger and yaki means to grill. It is made with thin strips of pork that are soft and juicy.</p>
