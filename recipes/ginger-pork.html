      <p>From <a href="https://www.justonecookbook.com/ginger-pork-shogayaki/">Just One Cookbook</a>. I haven't had a chance to make this dish yet, but I want to try cooking this dish soon! In Japanese, this dish is called "Shougayaki". Shouga is ginger and yaki means to grill. It is made with thin strips of pork that are soft and juicy.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <h4>For the Ginger Sauce</h4>
      <li>2 Tbsp soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 Tbsp mirin</li>
      <li>2 Tbsp sake</li>
      <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
      <li>1 Tbsp(5 cm ginger knob) ginger juice, grated and squeezed</li>
      <li>2-3 tsp ginger, grated</li>
      <li>1/2 onion (grate 1 Tbsp and slice rest)
      <h4>For the meat</h4>
      <li>340 g thinly sliced pork</li>
      <li>1 Tbsp sake</li>
      <li>1-2 Tbsp oil</li>
      <li>1 Tbsp flour (optional)</li>
      <li>freshly ground black pepper (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <h4>Make the Ginger Sauce</h4>
      <li>In a small bowl, combine 2 Tbsp soy sauce, 2 Tbsp mirin, 2 Tbsp sake, and 1 tsp sugar.</li>
      <li>Cut a 5 cm piece of ginger and peel the outer skin.</li>
      <li>Grate ginger and collect 100 g of ginger juice and save half of the juice for the pork.</li>
      <li>Add half of the ginger juice to the sauce bowl, and add about 2-3 tsp(to taste) of the grated ginger too.</li> 
      <li>Grate a 140 g onion until you get 1 Tbsp of grated onion and juice. (The rest of the onion will be fried with the meat later.)</li>
      <li>Add grated onion and juice to ginger sauce and mix well.</li>
      <h4>Prepare remaining ingredients</h4>
      <li>Cut the rest of the 140 g onion into thin slices.</li>
      <li>Prepare 340 g thinly sliced pork. Make slits in fatty white part of meat if meat is thicker than 3mm.</li>
      <li>Sprinkle half of ginger juice and 1 Tbsp sake on pork and set aside for 5 min.</li>
      <li>If pork is 3 mm or thicker, lightly sprinkle with 1 Tbsp of flour using a strainer.</li>
      <h4>Cook the Pork</h4>
      <li>Heat large frying pan over medium heat. Then add 1-2 Tbsp of oil. Place pork in a single layer in pan and flip over when brown.</li>
      <li>When pork is no longer pink, transfer them to a plate.</li>
      <li>Once pork is done, add more oil and onion slices.</li>
      <li>Saute onion slices on medium heat until golden brown, about 6-8 minutes.</li>
      <li>When onion slices become clear and soft, add pork to pan.</li>
      <li>Stir sauce and pour over pork. Bring sauce to a simmer and spoon it over pork for about 2 minutes.</li>
      <li>Season with freshly ground pepper if desired.</li>
      <li>When sauce has thickened, the ginger pork is done!</li>
    </ol>
